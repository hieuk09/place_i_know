## Travel

- When you go from Noi Bai Airport to Ha Noi center, you have several options:
  + Taxi: Mai Linh, Airport Taxi or Taxigroup probably the best one, their price
  is about 300.000-400.000 VND.
  + Minibus: There are minibuses stop near the entrance of the terminal, their
  price is about 40.000 VND. Minibuses leave the airport when full. They will
  only stop at pre-determined destinations, so you may need to use taxi to go to your
  hotel.
